## Your OpenAI API key (required)

OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'

## Neo4j Graph DB credentials (optional for memory, see README)

# NEO4J_URI=
# NEO4J_USER=neo4j
# NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password

## By default, the Worker and Client will connect to a local Temporal server (127.0.0.1:7233),
## on namespace 'default'. This is fine for development purposes and local testing.
##
## To use Temporal Cloud instead, uncomment the following:

# TEMPORAL_PROFILE='cloud'

## And follow instructions in the README for running demo on Temporal Cloud.

## Alternately, configure these variables.

# TEMPORAL_PROFILE='default'
# TEMPORAL_ADDRESS='127.0.0.1:7233'
# TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE='default'
# TEMPORAL_API_KEY=''


## The task queue to use for the worker

# TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE='research-queue'


## The Triage agent is responsible for deciding whether claryfing questions are needed, or
## if the initial query was already specific enough. This is nice in a real world scenario, but
## ain't great for demo purposes, where we _do_ want to show the clarifying agent in action.
## Setting this option to 'Y' will force the triage agent to ALWAYS ask for clarifying questions.

BYPASS_TRIAGE_AGENT='Y'


## Neo4j Memory Configuration (optional)
## Neo4j is used to persist conversation/workflow history, allowing users to
## resume previous conversations after page reloads.
##
## If not configured, the app will work without memory features (conversations
## won't be saved or resumable).

# NEO4J_URI='bolt://localhost:7687'
# NEO4J_USER='neo4j'
# NEO4J_PASSWORD='your-neo4j-password'


## Redpanda Event Streaming Configuration (optional)
## Configure these values for your Redpanda instance (local, cloud, or serverless).
## Multiple bootstrap servers can be specified as comma-separated values.
## Topics can be configured per event type for fine-grained streaming control.

## Connection Settings
# REDPANDA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS='localhost:9092'  # Comma-separated list of brokers

## Topic Configuration
## Use a single topic for all events or separate topics per event category
# REDPANDA_TOPIC='research-workflow-events'  # Default topic for all events
# REDPANDA_TOPIC_LIFECYCLE='workflow-lifecycle'  # query_received, research_complete, etc.
# REDPANDA_TOPIC_CLARIFICATIONS='workflow-clarifications'  # clarification events
# REDPANDA_TOPIC_RESEARCH='workflow-research'  # research pipeline events
# REDPANDA_TOPIC_ARTIFACTS='workflow-artifacts'  # image_generated, pdf_generated, etc.

## Security Configuration (required for Redpanda Serverless/Cloud)
# REDPANDA_SASL_MECHANISM='SCRAM-SHA-256'  # Options: SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512, PLAIN
# REDPANDA_SASL_USERNAME='your-username'
# REDPANDA_SASL_PASSWORD='your-password'
# REDPANDA_SECURITY_PROTOCOL='SASL_SSL'  # Options: PLAINTEXT, SASL_SSL, SSL
